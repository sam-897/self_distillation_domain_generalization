<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The aim of this project is to distinguish between fake and real speech and develop a system that can function in the cross domain scenario. We recreate a self distillation framework on the following networks : SENET,ECANET and RESNET. In addition, domain generalization methods, namely semi hard online triplet mining and domain adversarial learning with the use of gradient reverse layer are incorporated to imporve cross domain performance and enable the system to perform well on unseen datasets. </p
<h2>Datasets Used</h2>
<br>
<p>We deal with spoofed data of three different types; physical access, logical access and deepfake from three different sources as our train data.</p>
